# FractionOfPolicyImplementedThisYear.py
#
# This script is used to generate .csv policy schedule files for all built-in (reference) scenarios.
# It creates schedules in the formats expected by Vensim and by the web app.  It also creates the
# Policy Elements file required to populate the relevant subscript in Vensim.
#
# At least one schedule must be defined for every policy element.  Each schedule has a schedule number
# ahead of its data indicating which schedule file should use those data.  The script will produce
# files for a number of schedules defined by "MaxSchedules".  All the policy elements do not need to have
# the same number of schedules defined.  If you leave a particular schedule for a
# particular element undefined, the script will use the that policy element's first listed schedule.
# (The first listed schedule is typically, but not necessarily, labeled "Schedule 1".)
# For example, in "Example Policy Element", if you provide data only for "Schedule 1" and "Schedule 2",
# this script will use the data from whichever schedule is listed first (likely Schedule 1) to populate
# schedules 3 through MaxSchedules for Example Policy Element.
